## 🧰 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel for data analysis and visualization
- PowerPoint for reporting
- GitHub for version control

## 📊 Key Findings
- Freshmen and seniors showed the **most dissatisfaction** with proactive outreach from advisors
- **JSOM and ECS students** reported the most negative advising experiences, likely due to advisor-to-student ratios
- Feedback across gender was relatively consistent, but **males reported slightly more satisfaction**
- Items 15 and 11 (proactive outreach and discussing personal concerns) had the **highest dissatisfaction rates**

## 📌 Insights & Recommendations
- Consider **eliminating “neutral” response options** to prompt clearer sentiment
- Use feedback to **improve follow-up systems**, such as automated check-ins from advisors
- Investigate high-dissatisfaction majors for staffing improvements

## 🌟 Impact
This analysis can guide advising departments in resource allocation, outreach strategy, and student engagement.
